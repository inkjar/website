</header>
<div class="readable"><p>At Inkjar, we're proud of our works. We work our blood, sweat, and tears into every commission, project, and every thing big and small in-between. Because of such, we have special guidelines for how our works can be used. Questions about these guidelines can be sent to <a href="/contact">the respective branch managers.</a></p>
<h2 id="illustration">Illustration</h2>
<p>Our graphics take a lot of time and money and, because of such, we have to reserve all rights. If you want to license these works for your use, you can write to <a href="/contact">Tian Schmidt,</a> the illustration branch manager.</p>
<p>When we take photos for others, we give them the choice to license under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> or to reserve the rights amongst themselves. In the event of the latter, we create a non-revokable commercial license to use the graphics we design for using in our galleries on this site and others.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>Our photos take a lot of time, money, and planning; because of such, sadly, we have to reserve all rights. If you want to license these works for your use, you can write to <a href="/contact">Quy Pham,</a> the photography branch manager.</p>
<p>When we take photos for others, we give them the choice to license under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> or to reserve the rights amongst themselves. In the event of the latter, we create a non-revokable commercial license to use the photos we take for using in our galleries on this site and others.</p>
<h2 id="web-development">Web development</h2>
<p>This site's code is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/inkjar/inkjar.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE">3-Clause BSD license,</a> and can be found <a href="https://github.com/inkjar/inkjar.github.io">on our public GitHub.</a> We do this to help others learn from our hard work to craft their own portfolios and sites. Where not mentioned, assets like, but not limited to, icons, photos, and drawings follow an all rights reserved policy.</p>
<p>When we develop sites for others, we give them the choice to open-source their sites or to leave them closed. By default, we keep them closed-source with the only people with access being the person the site is for and, in the event that we are hosting the website, ourselves to build and maintain versions of the site for publishing.</p>
