		<h2 id="what-data-do-third-parties-have-access-to">What data do third-parties have access to?</h2>
		<p>When you apply for a position at Inkjar or submit a commission request, you submit the data through Google Forms. Google, in theory, has access to all the data submitted through this form and stored on Google's servers.</p>
		<h2 id="who-has-access-to-stored-data">Who has access to stored data?</h2>
		<p>The data is processed and stored by the following parties:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Inkjar executives:</strong> This is used only for the legitmate purpose of reviewing applications and ensuring we have the proper contact information for all members.</li>
			<li><strong>Inkjar members, including executives:</strong> This is used for the legitmate purpose of completing commissions. The only data members have access to are: the organisation or club (if any), the branches commissioned, the deadline provided, refrences submitted; and: descriptions of the work.</li>
			<li><strong>Uberspace and their subprocessors:</strong> Our website is hosted on Uberspace. The servers are located in Deutschland.</li>
			<li><strong>Google and their subprocessors:</strong> Commission requests and some of our applications are done through Google Forms and stored in Google Sheets, as well as Google Drive. They have theoretical access to all data submitted through these forms of submission. When streaming YouTube videos, either through the embeds on our site or through links to videos on our site, you fall under their privacy policy as well.</li>
			<li><strong>Yuko, Cloudflare, and their subprocessors:</strong> Some of our applications are done through Yuko. Your data is encrypted with a GPG key after being submitted and can only be decrypted by Inkjar executives. No one who works on Yuko can access that data. Yuko is hosted by Uberspace and is behind Cloudflare's worldwide CDN.</li>
			<li><strong>GitHub and their subprocessors:</strong> This is used for storing and hosting commissioned sites that do not have the knowledge, or budget, to host their sites. GitHub has access to both the source code of these sites, and the built versions of these sites. The source code of these sites is only made public under an open license upon explicit, written request.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We encourage all to read the privacy policies of all of the organisations with access to stored data and gather an understanding of how their data is used by those organisations.</p>
		<h2 id="your-rights-and-choices">Your rights and choices</h2>
		<p>We follow strict moral and ethical codes to ensure you are in control of the data you provide.</p>
		<h3 id="right-to-know">Right to know</h3>
		<p>Upon request, you have the right to have all data stored about you archived and sent to you via email. This archive can be in a format of your reasonable choice.</p>
		<h3 id="right-to-become-unknown-erasure">Right to become unknown/erasure</h3>
		<p>Upon request, you have the right to have all data stored about you deleted from our records and, to our knowledge, Google's. Due to legal reasons, if a commission is paid for, we have to keep this commission until the end of that fiscal year.</p>
		<h3 id="how-to-make-data-requests">How to make data requests</h3>
		<p>Write to us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@inkjar.org">gdpr@inkjar.org</a> with your full name and the email address you've provided to us. Within 72 hours, we will get back to you confirming your request, as well as provide you with when we will be able to complete your request.</p>
		<h2 id="data-storage-security-and-breaches">Data storage, security, and breaches</h2>
		<p>All data is encrypted using modern, standardised, and secure methods. Emails are sent to and from our servers use SPF and secure mail servers to protect both our privacy and yours, as well as better validate email authenticity. Our sites use HSTS, only use HTTPS, and have strict CSP policies to prevent any malicious scripts from being run. We sign DPAs and other privacy agreements to ensure data is handled strictly for the purpose of providing our services with other companies we work with to protect your data.</p>
		<p>We take appropriate measures to protect the data we store and to configure our servers to prevent data breaches, but no system or configuration is perfect, so we cannot assume responsibility in the event of a misconfiguration, poor setup, or conditions out of our control, cause data loss. In the event of a data breach, we'll notify all of the contact methods we can to disclose this breach within 72 hours of us becoming aware of such breach.</p>
